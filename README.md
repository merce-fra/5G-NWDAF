# 5G NWDAF

This is the central repository for the microservices _NWDAF_. It is based on the _submodules_ mechanisms provided by _git_.


## Description

The repository is composed of several submodules:

| Submodule | Description | Directory | Git URL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *3GPP API*s | Model classes generated by *OpenAPI* generator. | `./3gpp-apis` | [git@merce-gitlab.fr-merce.mee.com:artur/nwdaf-api-gateway.git](https://merce-gitlab.fr-merce.mee.com/gitlab/artur/nwdaf-api-gateway) |
| *libcommon* | Common *Python* library for *NWDAF* microservices | `./libcommon` | [git@merce-gitlab.fr-merce.mee.com:artur/nwdaf-libcommon.git](https://merce-gitlab.fr-merce.mee.com/gitlab/artur/nwdaf-libcommon) |
| *API Gateway* | _API Gateway_ service for *NWDAF*, written in _Python_ | `./api-gateway` | [git@merce-gitlab.fr-merce.mee.com:artur/nwdaf-api-gateway.git](https://merce-gitlab.fr-merce.mee.com/gitlab/artur/nwdaf-api-gateway) |
| *AnLF* | *AnLF* service for *NWDAF*, written in *Python* | `./anlf` | [git@merce-gitlab.fr-merce.mee.com:artur/nwdaf-anlf.git](https://merce-gitlab.fr-merce.mee.com/gitlab/artur/nwdaf-anlf) |

The *3GPP API*s and _libcommon_ submodules are libraries that are built locally and then used by other services. We might later remove them from this repository if a package repository system is set up on our _Gitlab_ instance.

The _API Gateway_ and _AnLF_ services are built into their own _Docker_ containers, and then orchestrated with _Docker Compose_.

## Clone

In order to clone the current repository and its submodules on your local environment, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone git@merce-gitlab.fr-merce.mee.com:artur/5g-nwdaf.git
cd ./5g-nwdaf
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

For this clone operation to succeed, you should have already set up an _SSH_ key for authentication on your _Gitlab_
profile and made sure the right _SSH_ configuration is present on your local
environment. [This tutorial](https://merce-gitlab.fr-merce.mee.com/gitlab/artur/gitlab-ssh-config/-/blob/main/README.md)
explains how to
do it.

You can then navigate to the freshly cloned repository to access the codebase:

```bash
cd ./5g-nwdaf
```
